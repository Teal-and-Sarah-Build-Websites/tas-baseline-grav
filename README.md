# tas-baseline-grav
Baseline structure. Starting point for our grav sites

## To use
Clone the basic grav repo (https://github.com/getgrav/grav.git) and rename it whatever you want for the project

Delete the user folder and clone this repo into the project, renaming this repo 'user'

from the project folder run "bin/grav install"

from the project folder run "php -S localhost:8000 system/router.php"

go to http://localhost:8000/ to view your site!



When you are ready to create a new repo for your new site, delete the user/.git, initialize a new repo from inside user and follow basic instructions to push to a new repo.
