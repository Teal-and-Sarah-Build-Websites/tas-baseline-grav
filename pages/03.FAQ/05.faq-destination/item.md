Several things! We accept pets, Lake Lemon offers beautiful scenery and solitude, we cater to all sized families, particularly those with children, our guest houses offer many of the same amenities as the more expensive lodging establishments, but at much less the price, and we are less than a full-day drive from several Midwestern cities.
