Yes! The Port Hole Bar & Restaurant is within walking distance of all our guest houses, and their catfish and burgers are popular with locals and tourists. The Port Hole is open for lunch and dinner. Just a few miles away is the Butler Winery, where tourists can enjoy tasty snacks and wine from the comfort of a large, beautifully covered deck that overlooks the winery's pond and vineyards.

As for other dining and entertainment options, all of our properties are conveniently located just 11 miles from Nashville's restaurants, shops, live shows and the Brown County State Park, and the same distance from Indiana University and Bloomington's ethnic cuisine, theaters, and diverse entertainment.
