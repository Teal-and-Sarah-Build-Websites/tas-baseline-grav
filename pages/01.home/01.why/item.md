If you only want to put one item in a page and have it fully displayed (i.e. not truncated like an item in a blog-list page.) Simply put the summary end notation at the end of the full content and keep the item as a blog item nested in a blog folder structure.

This page doesnt show in the nav menu due to the visible: false setting in it's blog.md frontmatter.

We can't wait any longer. We can't keep making tiny, incremental improvements and hoping, praying, someone else is going to fix this for us. Every community is going to have to do its part, and we have to do our part. Right here, right now, in Bloomington. If we get help from State or National governments, great! But we have to set a goal of cutting our own emissions by 45% in the next decade and start working towards it. We have to try.

Our leaders, unfortunately, aren't really even trying. Not really. Not yet, anyway. Mayor Hamilton has pushed for some progress on sustainability, but his policies don't even begin to go far enough. There are some on the City Council who appear to be trying to grapple with this issue, but few seemed to have fully grasped the consequences of our plight. It's not good enough.

We have to do better.

So, I'm going to do my part. If nothing else, I can make sure we have this conversation and grapple with the issue. I can put the goal on the table and say "We have to go there". We have to work to cut our emissions by 45% in the next decade. That means completely reconfiguring our transportation infrastructure to support low emissions modes (walking, biking, and public transit). It means getting solar and wind on the grid by any means necessary. It means helping people retrofit their homes for energy efficiency so we can cut home heating oil use. And it means finding ways to put pressure on local industry to cut their own emissions.

It's not going to be easy. And, in some cases, it may mean asking people to change long ingrained habits. But if we want there to be many future generations, we have to grapple with this challenge. I truly believe we can. Previous generations have overcome challenges just as great. Now it's our turn.
